% Section 1: Starting the Journey
\section{Starting the Journey}

\begin{frame}{The Quest to Understand Relationships}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Imagine you’re a detective in a world of data, trying to uncover how one thing—like house prices—relates to others, like size or location.
    \item That’s regression: a tool to ask, ``How does $Y$ change with $X$, and can we predict it?''
    \item It’s the bridge between stats, where we explain the past, and data science, where we predict the future—our journey begins here.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{A Simple Start: Linear Regression}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Let’s start small: picture a straight line connecting lung capacity ($Y$) to years of dust exposure ($X$): $Y = b_0 + b_1X$.
    \item $b_0$ is where we begin when $X$ is zero, and $b_1$ tells us how $Y$ shifts with each step of $X$.
    \item We’ll predict ($\hat{Y}$) and measure our errors (residuals: $Y - \hat{Y}$)—this simple line is our first clue.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Finding the Best Fit: Least Squares}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item How do we draw that line? We minimize the mess—sum of squared errors: $\sum (Y - \hat{Y})^2$.
    \item Think of it like fitting a key into a lock: Legendre and Gauss showed us this trick centuries ago.
    \item It’s fast and reliable, but watch out—outliers can throw us off in small cases. Let’s keep this tool in our kit.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Section 2: Broadening the Picture
\section{Broadening the Picture}

\begin{frame}{More Clues: Multiple Linear Regression}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item One clue isn’t enough for complex mysteries like house prices. Enter multiple regression: $Y = b_0 + b_1X_1 + b_2X_2 + \dots$.
    \item Now we’re juggling size, lot area, and bedrooms—each adding its own twist to the story.
    \item We measure success with RMSE (prediction error) and $R^2$ (how much we’ve explained)—our map is getting richer.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Categories Join the Tale: Factor Variables}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Not all clues are numbers. What if a house is a townhouse or single-family? These are categories—factor variables.
    \item We turn them into switches (0 or 1) and pick a baseline to compare against, like choosing a starting point on a map.
    \item Suddenly, property type shapes our price predictions—our story’s cast of characters grows.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Curves in the Plot: Nonlinear Regression}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Straight lines don’t always fit. A small home’s value jumps more with extra space than a mansion’s—relationships bend.
    \item We add curves with polynomials ($X^2$), splines (smooth segments), or GAMs (auto-curves)—like sketching a winding path.
    \item This flexibility lets us follow the data’s true shape—our story’s not so straight anymore.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Section 3: Refining Our Craft
\section{Refining Our Craft}

\begin{frame}{Checking Our Work: Model Assessment}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item How do we know our story holds? RMSE tells us how far off our predictions are, while $R^2$ shows how much we’ve captured.
    \item Tools like R and Python give us these clues—data scientists care about hitting the target, not just the fine print.
    \item It’s like proofreading our tale—does it make sense, and will it hold up?
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Testing the Future: Cross-Validation}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Predicting isn’t just about today’s data—it’s about tomorrow’s. Cross-validation splits our clues into $k$ pieces.
    \item We train on most, test on one, and repeat—ensuring our story doesn’t just fit the past but foretells the future.
    \item This keeps us honest, avoiding a tale too tailored to what we already know.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Picking the Best Story: Model Selection}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Too many clues clutter the tale. Stepwise selection trims variables, AIC balances fit and simplicity, and penalties shrink extras.
    \item Think of it as editing: keep the essentials, cut the fluff—Occam’s razor guides us to a lean, powerful narrative.
    \item Our goal? A story that’s clear and predicts well, not a sprawling epic.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Weighing the Evidence: Weighted Regression}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Some clues carry more weight—like recent house sales over old ones. We assign weights to reflect this trust.
    \item In our housing tale, weighting by years since 2005 tweaks the story slightly, giving fresher data more say.
    \item It’s like listening harder to the loudest voices in a crowded room—refining our focus.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Section 4: Navigating Pitfalls
\section{Navigating Pitfalls}

\begin{frame}{Limits of Prediction: Extrapolation and Uncertainty}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Predicting too far—like an empty lot’s price—leads us astray. We stay within our data’s bounds.
    \item Uncertainty creeps in: confidence intervals frame coefficients, prediction intervals widen for single guesses.
    \item Bootstrapping resimulates our tale to measure this fuzziness—keeping us grounded.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Decoding the Clues: Interpreting Coefficients}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Clues can trick us: correlated factors (size and bedrooms) confuse, multicollinearity destabilizes, and missing pieces (location) mislead.
    \item Interactions—like size mattering more in fancy zip codes—add depth we can’t ignore.
    \item We must read between the lines, ensuring our story doesn’t twist the truth.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Spotting Flaws: Regression Diagnostics}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Outliers, and influential points can distort the regression line—diagnostic tools help identify them.
    \item Uneven errors (heteroskedasticity) or curved fits (partial residuals) hint at missing chapters.
    \item For prediction, we care less about perfection and more about what works—our lens shifts.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

% Section 5: Bringing It Home
\section{Bringing It Home}

\begin{frame}{The Story in Action: Housing Examples}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Our housing tale comes alive: linear fits tie price to size, while splines curve with reality’s bends.
    \item Diagnostics reveal a twist—a cheap house was a partial sale, and key points sway our line.
    \item It’s not just theory—it’s a tool for real predictions, grounded in data’s quirks.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{Lessons from the Journey}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Regression bends from simple lines to winding curves, adapting to any tale.
    \item We chase prediction—RMSE and cross-validation keep us on track—while interpretation demands caution.
    \item Tools like R and Python fuel our quest, turning data into stories that predict and inform.
  \end{itemize}
\end{frame}

\begin{frame}{The Road Ahead}
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Want more? ``An Introduction to Statistical Learning'' or ``Practical Time Series Forecasting with R'' deepen the tale.
    \item Explore splines or time series next—our journey’s just begun.
    \item Regression’s power lies in its blend of art and science—keep asking, predicting, and refining.
  \end{itemize}
